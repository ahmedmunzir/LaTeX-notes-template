A template for notes written in LaTeX
Recommend using [Visual](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for compilation using [LaTeX Workshop](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) which is an extension.

Document accent colour can be changed in mahmed.cls, alter the RGB value to your liking.

I have also included a LaTeX command cheatsheet which can be used for reference in visual studio code to quickly typeset commands.
